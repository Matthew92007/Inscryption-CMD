# Inscryption-CMD
Inscryption-CMD is a miniaturized version of a game named "Inscryption". Inscryption-CMD features a player making their way through a forest in search of food and shelter. The only thing the player has to help them are their animal companions. During their treacherous journey, they will encounter obstacles and surprises, some good, and some deadly. Can you make it to the end... if there even is one? 

Created as a final project for CSCI 1300 at CU Boulder.
